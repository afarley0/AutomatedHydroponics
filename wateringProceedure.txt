waterSubzone states

-same solution
	-whole line system is filled with solution
	-TURN ON EMITTER VALVE
		-ZONE VALVE AND SUBZONE VALVE
	-(interlock check to ensure pump is on)	
	
-different solution
	1: OPEN FWV(FLUSHING WATER VALVE), FLUSH TANK MANIFOLD (TURN ON FORWARD VALVE, OPEN RV (REVERSE VALVE)
	TURN ON FORWARD PUMP, TURN ON REVERSE PUMP)
	2: CLOSE FORWARD VALVE, CLOSE FLUSHING WATER VALVE, TURN OFF FORWARD PUMP
	3: OPEN ZONE VALVE, OPEN SEMV(SPECIAL EMITTER MANIFOLD VALVE; check valve nonsense)
	4: CLOSE SEMV, CLOSE Z#V
	5: OPEN FV, TURN ON FP, OPEN RV, OPEN RP
	6: OPEN SOLUTION VALVE, DELAY (FLUSH FOR A FEW SECONDS TO CLEAR FRESH WATER
	7: CLOSE RP, CLOSE RV, OPEN Z#V, PRIME EM (EMITTER MANIFOLD), OPEN SZV (SUBZONE VALVE)
END WATERING
	8: CHECK TO SEE IF THERE IS MORE WATERING TO DO IN THE ZONE
	9A: iF YES {TURN OFF SZV, REPEAT CLEARING SYSTEM, RERUN different solution}
	9B: IF NO {CLOSE SBZMV (SUBZONE MANIFOLD), CLOSE FV, CLOSE TMV, TURN OFF FP
	10:
